#Cajun Crab Dip 
###Ingredients

* Real Crab meat: This is found in a few other classifications by the size of the crab pieces. The larger pieces in jumbo are delicious, BUT claw meat is usually more affordable and the crab meat gets broken down a bit anyway in the dip, so buying claw meat for this dip works perfectly.
* Creamy stuff: I use a combo of cream cheese, mayonnaise, and sour cream for a perfect creamy/melty vibe without anything tasting like mayonnaise. You need all three, and full-fat versions, always.
* Shredded cheddar cheese: As sharp as you like!
* Seasonings: Worcestershire sauce, Cajun seasoning (Tony's is my favorite!), onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. We want our dip to have a kick!
* Fresh stuff: fresh jalapeno, lemon zest, and thinly sliced scallions break up the creamy flavors and brighten up the entire recipe. YUM.


##Step by Step
- Before you start the dip, pick through the crab meat just a bit to be sure there aren't any pieces of shell that got missed when the crab was being packaged.
- Then, combine all the ingredients in a large bowl. Save a few scallions for topping the dip, if you'd like - but that's just for presentation and not necessary.

- Gently mix the dip together to keep some large pieces of crab intact. You can taste the dip here since the crab is pasteurized - it's very, very yummy even without the cheese being melted yet.
- Transfer the crab dip to a small baking dish. At this point you can cover the dip and keep it in the fridge for a few days as a make-ahead situation.

- When you'd like to serve, bake the dip at 350F for 20-30 minutes until it's hot and bubbly.
- The cheese and mayo brown beautifully on top and just wowowow look at that golden beauty. Let the dip rest at room temp for 5-10 minutes, then serve!
